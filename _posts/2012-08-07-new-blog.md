## Blogging with jekyll and github
I just set this up and don't really have anything to say at the moment. My blogging efforts usually only last a few months because I tend to get too lazy at some point. This setup with ```jekyll``` and ```git``` hosted on ```github``` however seems awesome. The setup takes about a minute and afterwards all you really need it ```git```. See [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
