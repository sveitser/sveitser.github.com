Hong Kong waters and beaches are suffering from a spill of plastic pellets after (probably at least) six containers fell off a cargo ship during typhoon Vincente. Apparently the pellets are inert initially. They will however absorb pollutants over time whilst being mistaken for food by fish. Needless to say even if harmless at first, these plastic pellets don't belong on Hong Kong's coast line. So go pick up some. See _PlasticDisasterHongKong_'s [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PlasticDisasterHongKong) for more information.

I went to Tung O Beach on Lamma Island, one of the most affected spots, to pick up some nurdles with a group of people organised by [Green Sense](http://greensense.org.hk/en/). I was positively surprised by the amount of people who turned up and glad to see so many teenagers as well as people in their twenties. Happy to see so many young people realize their future isn't just about the bank account balance. I received way too much credit for what I did and ended up on [BBC News](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19151491), on _TIME Magazine_'s [newsfeed](http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/07/hong-kongs-plastic-pellet-problem-its-beaches-are-littered-with-millions-of-them/) and in dozens of newspapers thanks to AP.
